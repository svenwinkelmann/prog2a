# We've learned that binary search trees are highly efficient data structures for
# maintaining ordered data. For our vending machine implementation, it would be
# very helpful if our dictionary maintained its keys in descending order. Java
# provides a built-in data structure called TreeMap for this purpose.
# Does Python offer something similar?

# Let's ask an LLM: "I need a size-ordered dictionary in Python. What data structure
# is efficient? Give an example."

# In Python, the built-in dict does not maintain the keys in sorted order â€” it maintains
# insertion order (since Python 3.7+). If you need a dictionary with keys automatically
# kept in sorted order, the most efficient solution is:
#   - use SortedDict from the sortedcontainers library
#   - keys stay automatically sorted.
#   - efficient operations: O(log n) for insert, delete, and lookup.
# Install it: pip install sortedcontainers
